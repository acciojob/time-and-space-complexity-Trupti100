    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the measure of how long an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. It allows us to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, meaning it can solve a problem quickly even for larger inputs.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another crucial factor in algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to execute based on the size of its input. Algorithms with lower space complexity are considered more memory-efficient.</p>
