  <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
  
  <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity is low, which means it can process input quickly and complete its task without unnecessary delays.</p>
  
  <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, focuses on the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to run. It's often denoted by O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Space complexity becomes crucial when dealing with large datasets, as an algorithm that uses excessive memory can lead to performance issues.</p>
  
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> plays a vital role in optimizing algorithms for memory usage, ensuring that they use only the necessary amount of memory and avoiding wastage.</p>
